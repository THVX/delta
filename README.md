### Write smarter code with Delta.

Alpha is a C/C++ library for creating apps without struggling, inspirated from [ChaiScript](https://chaiscript.com/).
To get started with Delta, download the Delta SDK from the Releases page. It includes Delta's standard library, VSCode, and MinGW-x64.
Extract the Alpha.zip file, and move the folder to your C: drive. Browse to VSCode\VSCode-win32-x64-1.63.2\ and open the VSCode.exe app. It includes the C++ extension pack and is pre-configured to use Delta SDK's compiler.

The Delta SDK's compiler is designed to run Delta files (ending in .dlt), C files (.c) and C++files (.cpp).


NOTE: To compile an Delta file, DO NOT USE G++ ALONE. Instead use **C:\Alpha\MinGW\mingw32\bin\g++.exe -I C:\Alpha\Alpha\lib _path/to/your/file.cpp_** *

### Start coding happily !
