### Alpha
### Boom your apps with Alpha !

Alpha is a C/C++ library for creating console apps without difficulty.
To get started with Alpha, download it from the Releases page. Alpha includes its standard library, VSCode, and MinGW-x64.
Extract the Alpha.zip file, and move the folder to your C: drive. Browse to VSCode\VSCode-win32-x64-1.63.2\ and open the VSCode.exe app. It includes the C++ extension pack.


# NOTE: To compile an Alpha file, DO NOT USE G++ ALONE. Instead use **C:\Alpha\MinGW\mingw32\bin\g++.exe -I C:\Alpha\Alpha\lib _yourfile.cpp_**

### Start coding happily !
